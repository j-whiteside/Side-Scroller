	The HMS Traveller has been ambushed by an unknown enemy.  The crew managed to escape the ship before it blew up,
	but they are stranded in space.  Your objective is to collect as many 
	survivors as possible, while avoiding the debris.
	Colliding with debris will cause you to lose one of your three lives.
	The game is over when you lose all your lives.
	You get points for staying alive, and for collecting survivors

	Good luck space cadet.
